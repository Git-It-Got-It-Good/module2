<!-- I am not a particular fan of poetry, unfortunately, so choosing a poem was a chore. In all honesty, many of my favorite poems are children's poems. Since I chose children's poems for S507, I decided to go with something slightly more "sophisticated" for S531 (though I also deliberately chose something short!). The topic of snow seemed appropriate for this time of year. -->

 <!-- I want to figure out why the image centers beautifully but the text does not. I also want to know how to "preset" the image size so its loading does not affect the text position on the page (I hate when text "bounces" as images load), while still enabling responsiveness (I tried using fixed width and height, but that destroyed the responsiveness). -->

<p>
Whose woods these are I think I know.<br>
His house is in the village, though;<br>
He will not see me stopping here<br>
To watch his woods fill up with snow.
</p>
<p>
My little horse must think it's queer<br>
To stop without a farmhouse near<br>
Between the woods and frozen lake<br>
The darkest evening of the year.<br>
</p>
<p>
He gives his harness bells a shake<br>
To ask if there is some mistake.<br>
The only other sound's the sweep<br>
Of easy wind and downy flake.
</p>
<p>
The woods are lovely, dark, and deep,<br>
But I have promises to keep,<br>
And miles to go before I sleep,<br>
And miles to go before I sleep.<br>
